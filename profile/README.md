# MyMeds

## About the Project
MyMeds is a medication inventory, tracking and notification application. It displays a userâ€™s medications in a simple consolidated way showing dose, amount and timing. MyMeds is also a reminder service via visual, email and sms text messages to ensure a user does not miss a dose and when they can retake their meds.

This was the Capstone Project for Turing School of Software and Design's Front End and Back End Engineering programs and won first place in Turing's Demo Competition.

## Using the Application
From the dashboard, the user can see their current medications. If it's time to take their meds, they can click the ### Take My Meds ### button to start the timer for when they will next need to take them. The user will also receive email and text notifications when it's time to take their meds. If a user no longer needs their medication reminders, they can choose to delete any med from their dashboard.

If the user needs to add a new medication, they can click on the **Add Meds** button in the top right of the screen. From that page the user can search through a list of FDA approved medications. Once they've found their med, they can continue to fill out necessary details, such as the quantity in the prescription, how often they should take their med, and any other reminders, including if they should take that med with food or avoid alcohol.
